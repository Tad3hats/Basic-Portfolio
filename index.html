          Thanks for your interest in me!  
          I have worked at United Airlines for 13 years in various capacities, but primarily as a product development manager and systems analyst.
          Before that, I worked in Consulting at PwC, got my MBA at Notre Dame, and spent some time with startups in the Bay Area.

          <br>
          I enjoy product management, because I get to work with a variety of companies and people to design, launch, and support programs that have a financial impact and enhance customer loyalty. 
          Although I have a non-technical background, I learned quickly that embracing technology helped my career.
          Sadly, I also found that many folks who were less technically savvy were often the first to be let go.
          <br>
          <br>
          The best advice I got in Silicon Valley was from a developer.
          He told me that if I wanted to be a great product manager, I would need to get to know as many developers as I could.
          I have since worked with many developers on projects, but now I am excited to be on the other side of the fence!
